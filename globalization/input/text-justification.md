# Text Justification

Some scripts or cultures have special rules about how text is justified. Justification refers to how the text aligns with the margins of an object. The object can be page, a column, a table, a shape, etc.

## Justification within a Table

For East Asian language, the first and last characters of each line (except the last) are aligned to the left and right margins, and lines are filled by adding or subtracting space between and within words. This is also called [distributed alignment](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd948449(v=office.12).aspx#gt_dae18ea5-2a98-4e10-9570-7f4ac695c6b8).

## Thai Text Justification

The main difference between Thai text justification and English justification is that Thai places spaces between clusters while English distributes spaces between words.

## Kashida Justification

Kashida is a character elongation used in Arabic language to increase the length of the line connecting to characters (and it does not affect the sound or the meaning of the word), it’s also used in text justification instead of white-space. (Note that there may be multiple kashidas.)

Here is a typical Arabic text with and without kashida justification:
