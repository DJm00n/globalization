# Prioritize components for globalization testing

Some components are more likely to have globalization problems than others, so part of globalizing the test means adapting your testing practices accordingly.
Assign a globalization priority to all components that are going to be tested.
Top priority goes to:

- Components that extensively handle text data.

- Applications using files for data storage or data exchange.

- Components that have had many globalization problems in the past.

After determining which components are more likely to have serious globalization errors, choose a viable test platform in accordance with your particular circumstances.
