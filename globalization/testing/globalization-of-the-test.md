# Globalization of the Test

The first step to test the world-readiness of a product is to verify that its functionality is globalized. As you've seen, this is done by modifying legacy test cases-or globalizing the test. Globalization represents functionality that is an intrinsic, inseparable part of a system or product. Rather than testing for globalization of every single system component of multiple products, which would require far too many resources and hours, by globalizing the test you check for world-readiness at the same time you check the general functionality of a core product's entire system.
