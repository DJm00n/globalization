# Roles and responsibilities

Goal: describe activities that need should happen for a successful global product.

- Two well-defined areas of work in the i18n pipeline: upstream (task corresponding to source) and downstream (tasks corresponding to target).
- Upstream: architecture, design, code development, user experience, content creation, globalization localizability, product/program management.
- Downstream: translation, adaptation, engineering, tools development, language validation, project management.
- This document will focus on upstream activities.
- Timing for engaging in these activities is critical. If i18n aspects are not considered at each step, particularly at the initial ones (architecture, design, ux), world-readiness is at risk and fixing it will be expensive.

Types of tasks/best-practices:

- Managerial: feature design, globalization and localizability sign-off, definition of style guides, issue tracking, schedule alignments (loc to dev).
- Technical: leveraging g11n APIs, code validation, metadata annotation, parsing, localizability validation (pseudo-loc), creation of localized builds.

Upstream tasks are typically shared between development international/localization teams within organizations.
