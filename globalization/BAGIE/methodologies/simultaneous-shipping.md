# Simultaneous shipping

- Simutaneous shipping means to release all localized versions of a given software product, together with the source one.
- In today's globalized world, reaching the full extent of your audience will require you to simultaneously ship all of the localized versions offered.
- A couple of decades ago, simultaneously shipping all localized versions was a great challenge. Many contraints: development models, long milestones, localization engineering challenges, slower pipeline (multiple translation agencies, smaller pool of translators, etc.). Often required to have in-house localizers and the language extent for sim-shipping will be limited to a few language, with an incremental delivery roadmap of at least a month after the first wave.
- Today, things have changed significantly in all fronts. Ready-to-ship software updates can be available even a couple of times per day. Localization service providers can turnaround a considerable volune of translations in just a few hours.
