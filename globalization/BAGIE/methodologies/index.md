# Delivering products globally

- Delivering products globally should be understood as providing customers with rich experiences that they can feel as developed specifically for them, matching their local expectations that go beyond the functionality.
- Is is particularly important to be intentional and specific about the scope of the intended audience (countries/regions and languages), bearing in mind that there could be legal or regulatory hurdles to tackle.
- Knowing your markets and audience will allow you to have a better impact, and make your product and organization more relevant to your end-users. 
- Delivering software products worldwide is a complex process that involves many disciplines within an organization, including contributors from research and development, content development, legal, marketing, operations, produrement, finance, localization, sales, support, among several others.
- This guide should provide a high-level description and a short example on how each of these functions participate in the delivery.
