# Global products under agile development

Agile development, under many different variants, is perhaps  the most common development methodology used in the software industry.
Under such methodology, functionality updates are more frequent (daily, weekly, monthly sprints) as opposed to long yearly milestones.
Planning for the next milestone/sprint happens on-the-fly, depending on customer feedback, strategy updates, and other factors.
Once a sprint is delivered, it becomes harder to go back and fix issues with previous implementations, since people working on those features (feature crew) may have moved on to other features for the upcoming sprint, and there's no guarantee that those previous features will remain the same; they may significantly change or be removed.
So, it is important to ensure that the particularities of international development are addressed at the right time.

Consider addressing the following aspects of international development:

- [Roles and responsibilities](roles-and-responsibilities.md)
- [Continuous delivery](continuous-delivery.md)
- [Simultaneous shipping](simultaneous-shipping.md)
- [Exit criteria](exit-criteria.md)
