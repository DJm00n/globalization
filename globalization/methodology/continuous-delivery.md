# Continuous delivery

- As software development projects become more and more agile, with much shorter sprints where functionality updates as very frequent, internationalization and localization models require transitioning from taking regular snapshots following a pre-defined schedule, to delivering near-immediate localized content as updates become available.

- Continuous localization implies that there is a tight integration between the different components that form the international delivery system, from managing the source and translation of content to real-time validation for both.

- Automation and integrated systems for the whole roundtrip are essential for achieving successful continuous deliveries.

- It is important to note that business models for all services involved in the process would require revisiting.
