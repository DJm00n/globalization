# Transcreation localization strategy

Transcreation is a localization strategy often used in marketing and advertising content.
It is the process of adapting content from one language or culture to another while maintaining its intent, style, tone, and context.
The scope of changes in transcreation is much broader than a straightforward sentence-by-sentence translation.
The result is likely to be a unique body of work with few 1:1 correspondences with the source material.
