# Delivering products globally

Delivering products globally should be understood as providing customers with rich experiences that they can feel as developed specifically for them, matching their local expectations that go beyond the functionality.
Is is particularly important to be intentional and specific about the scope of the intended audience (countries, regions and languages), bearing in mind that there could be legal or regulatory hurdles to tackle.
Knowing your markets and audience will allow you to have a better impact, and make your product and organization more relevant to your end-users.

Delivering software products worldwide is a complex process that involves many disciplines within an organization,
including contributors from research and development, content development, legal, marketing, operations, procurement, finance, localization, sales, support, and several others.

This guide provide a high-level description and a short examples on how each of these roles participate in the delivery of a global product.
