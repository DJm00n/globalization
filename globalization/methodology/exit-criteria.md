# Localization exit criteria

Every development milestone, short or long, agile or waterfall, should have a set of indicators for key areas to ensure the quality and thustworthiness of the target milestone.
Some of these areas are security, privacy, accessibility, reliability, performance. Internationalization should also be included as one of these key areas, to ensure that your software fullfils customer expectations associated with their localation, including language, regional formats, and several other factors.

Creating an internationalization exit criteria should be done even if your release is only targeting English as a language. English is widely spoken in many locations worlwide.

Internationalization readiness involves several layers of product development, including user research, architectural and design considerations, programming (coding), localizability, legal and compliance requirements.
Although the delivery of such requirements can be prioritized and staggered across several milestones, depending on the global scope of the intended releases, some of them have strong downstream dependencies.
If those foundational aspects are not addressed from the very beginning, trying to incorporate them in the later milestones could prove to be very costly.
In some cases it would require redesigning and refactoring efforts.

These are some of the aspects that you should include in your internationalization exit criteria:

- Text support requirements

- String authoring conventions

- Language and location considerations

- User interface and layout requirements

Such aspects are usually validated through testing, more specifically:

- Global test design

- Localizability testing

- Localization testing

- Test case samples
