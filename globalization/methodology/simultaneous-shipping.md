# Simultaneous shipping

Simultaneous shipping means to release all localized versions of a given software product, together with the source version.

In today's globalized world, reaching the full extent of your audience will require you to simultaneously ship all of the localized versions offered.
A couple of decades ago, simultaneously shipping all localized versions was a great challenge, or impossible.
Many constraints work against simultaneous shipping: development models, long milestones, localization engineering challenges, and a slower translation pipeline with multiple translation agencies and smaller pool of translators.
This often required in-house localizers and the language extent for sim-shipping will be limited to a few languages, with an incremental delivery roadmap of at least a month after the first wave.

Today, things have changed significantly in all fronts.
Ready-to-ship software updates can be available even a couple of times per day.
Localization service providers can turn around a considerable volume of translations in just a few hours.

Being able to ship all languages simultaneously requires an integrated [continuous delivery](continuous-delivery.md) system.
